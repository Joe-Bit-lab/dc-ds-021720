(Likewise, the words `yesterday`, `today`, `tomorrow` and `Tuesday` must be related, since they occur in the context of a word indicating a temperature.)\n",

Maybe you can see where I'm going with this. What if we made a *really big* spreadsheet that had one column for every context for every word in a given source text. Let's use a small source text to begin with, such as this excerpt from Dickens:\n",

It might be strange to think of it, but you can do vector arithmetic on vectors with ten dimensions just as easily as you can on vectors with two or three dimensions, and you could use the same distance formula that we defined earlier to get useful information about which vectors in this space are similar to each other. In particular, the vectors for `best` and `worst` are actually the same (a distance of zero), since they occur only in the same context (`the ___ of`):\n",

    "Of course, in a corpus of any reasonable size, there will be many thousands if not many millions of possible contexts. It's difficult enough working with a vector space of ten dimensions, let alone a vector space of a million dimensions! It turns out, though, that many of the dimensions end up being superfluous and can either be eliminated or combined with other dimensions without significantly affecting the predictive power of the resulting vectors. The process of getting rid of superfluous dimensions in a vector space is called [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction), and most implementations of count-based word vectors make use of dimensionality reduction so that the resulting vector space has a reasonable number of dimensions (say, 100—300, depending on the corpus and application).\n",
    "\n",
    "The question of how to identify a \"context\" is itself very difficult to answer. In the toy example above, we've said that a \"context\" is just the word that precedes and the word that follows. Depending on your implementation of this procedure, though, you might want a context with a bigger \"window\" (e.g., two words before and after), or a non-contiguous window (skip a word before and after the given word). You might exclude certain \"function\" words like \"the\" and \"of\" when determining a word's context, or you might [lemmatize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation) the words before you begin your analysis, so two occurrences with different \"forms\" of the same word count as the same context. These are all questions open to research and debate, and different implementations of procedures for creating count-based word vectors make different decisions on this issue.\n",

    "* [Word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) is another procedure for producing word vectors which uses a predictive approach rather than a context-counting approach. [This paper](http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/marco/publications/acl2014/baroni-etal-countpredict-acl2014.pdf) compares and contrasts the two approaches. (Spoiler: it's kind of a wash.)\n",
    "* If you want to train your own word vectors on a particular corpus, the popular Python library [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) has an implementation of Word2Vec that is relatively easy to use. [There's a good tutorial here.](https://rare-technologies.com/word2vec-tutorial/)\n",
    "* When you're working with vector spaces with high dimensionality and millions of vectors, iterating through your entire space calculating cosine similarities can be a drag. I use [Annoy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/annoy) to make these calculations faster, and you should consider using it too."
